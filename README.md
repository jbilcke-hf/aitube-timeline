# @aitube/react-timeline

*React component to display a .clap timeline*

## Introduction

This is a work in progress project.

For the moment the component is read-only, and can only display text.

More instructions will be provided until we can do more with it.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @aitube/react-timeline
```

Depending on your project configuration and package manager, you my need to install some additional packages manually, such as React, Radix, Tailwind, Three.js, Zustand etc:

```bash
npm i @aitube/clap @aitube/colors @radix-ui/react-slider @react-spring/three @react-spring/types @react-three/drei @react-three/fiber @types/react @types/react-dom react react-dom tailwindcss three typescript zustand
```

This project is currently not designed to be used with other tools such as Svelte, Vue, or other state manager. However if there is demand (eg. more than one person asking for it) it might evolve to become more modular in the future.
